    <h2>About</h2>
    <p><strong>Purpose of the document&nbsp;—</strong> this design document
       records every decision made while creating <em>OntoGSN</em>.</p>
  
    <p><strong>Goal of the ontology&nbsp;—</strong> enable users to create,
       maintain, align, evaluate, explain and display assurance cases with the
       help of semantic‑web technology. Key benefits include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>native storage and querying of graph data;</li>
      <li>human‑readable, visualisable domain representation;</li>
      <li>seamless linking to data, documents and code in one store;</li>
      <li>logic‑based quality verification through rule engines;</li>
      <li>a foundation for advanced methods such as GraphRAG; and</li>
      <li>an active, mostly open‑source tooling ecosystem.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p><strong>Methodology&nbsp;—</strong> every sentence of the GSN Community
       Standard v3 is translated into OWL 2 triples (classes & properties),
       complemented by SWRL rules for constraints.</p>
  
    <p><strong>Technical implementation&nbsp;—</strong> the ontology is authored
       in Stanford Protégé 5.6.3, imports RDFS, XSD, Dublin Core, Schema.org and
       SKOS, and is reasoned over with SWRL‑capable engines such as Pellet or
       Drools.</p>
